# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Python Adoption for Prototype Development

## Status
Approved

## Date
2025-05-11

## Context
When developing an application utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), it is necessary to select development languages and frameworks in the initial stage. Given the current requirement for rapid prototype development (PoC), an optimal technology stack must be selected.

## Decision
We will adopt Python for the prototype development phase.

## Rationale
1. **Rich LLM Libraries**
   - Python ecosystem offers comprehensive LLM-related libraries such as LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and LlamaIndex
   - These libraries are actively maintained and quickly adapt to the latest LLM models and techniques

2. **Suitability for PoC Stage**
   - Python possesses language characteristics ideal for short-term prototype development (high productivity, concise syntax)
   - Rich peripheral functions necessary for LLM applications, including data processing, natural language processing, and machine learning
   - Scripting language characteristics enable rapid development cycles

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Accelerated development speed allows for early user feedback
- Rapid implementation of LLM features due to rich libraries
- Compatibility with data science and machine learning tasks

### Concerns
- Potential performance issues in large-scale systems
- Type safety constraints (can be mitigated using TypeHint)
- Scalability challenges in production environments

## Alternatives
1. **Node.js/TypeScript**
   - Pros: Strong type system, advantages in asynchronous processing, frontend-backend unification
   - Cons: LLM-specific libraries not as extensive as Python

2. **Go**
   - Pros: High performance, excellent concurrent processing, static typing
   - Cons: LLM ecosystem still developing, potentially slower development speed than Python

3. **Java/Kotlin**
   - Pros: Integration with enterprise systems, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Lower development agility, excessive boilerplate code

## Future Direction
- Utilize Python for rapid feature verification during the PoC stage
- When transitioning to production, consider the following options based on performance and scalability requirements:
  1. Continue using Python (with high-performance frameworks like FastAPI)
  2. Migrate only performance-critical parts to languages like Java/Kotlin
