# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Adoption of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status
Accepted

## Date

## Context
Our organization is developing a product that leverages AI to help teams create, manage, and extract insights from Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). As we embark on this journey, we recognize the critical importance of "dogfooding" - using our own processes to gain firsthand experience and insights that directly inform our product development.

The challenges we aim to solve with our product are ones we face ourselves:
- Knowledge loss when team members leave or move between projects
- Difficulty in onboarding new team members
- Repeated discussions of previously settled issues
- Inconsistent implementation of architectural patterns
- Challenges in understanding the historical context of the codebase

By seriously implementing ADRs within our own organization, we will:
1. Gain authentic insights into the ADR workflow and pain points
2. Generate real examples and use cases for our AI training and testing
3. Better understand how AI can augment the ADR creation and interpretation process
4. Experience the value proposition of our product firsthand

This direct experience is invaluable as we develop a product aimed at making architectural decision documentation more efficient and valuable through AI assistance.

## Decision
We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as our standard method for documenting significant architectural decisions. Specifically:

1. Repository-specific technical decisions will be documented in a `docs/adr` directory within each repository
2. Organization-wide decisions that affect multiple repositories or teams will be documented in the central `org-adr` repository under its `docs/adr` directory
3. We will follow a standardized format for all ADRs (as defined in `0000-adr-template.md`)
4. ADRs will be numbered sequentially, starting with 0001 (after the template)
5. ADRs will be written in Markdown format for easy viewing in GitHub/GitLab and other tools

## Rationale
- ADRs provide a lightweight, structured approach to document architectural decisions
- Keeping repository-specific ADRs within each repository ensures that the documentation stays close to the code it describes
- A central repository for organization-wide decisions provides visibility across teams
- The standardized format ensures consistency and makes ADRs easier to read and write
- Markdown format provides good readability while remaining simple to edit and track in version control
- As a team building AI tools for ADR management, our firsthand experience with ADRs is critical for product development
- "Dogfooding" our own ADR practices will generate valuable insights that directly inform our product features

## Implications
### Positive Implications
- Improved knowledge preservation and transfer within the organization
- Better onboarding experience for new team members
- Reduced time spent revisiting decisions that have already been made
- Enhanced visibility into the decision-making process
- Creation of an organizational memory that persists beyond individual team members

### Concerns
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Potential for ADRs to become outdated if not maintained
- Risk of creating too many or too few ADRs if criteria aren't clear
- Need for team members to learn and adopt the ADR process

## Alternatives
1. **Wiki-based documentation**
   - Pros: Familiar format, easier editing for non-technical team members
   - Cons: Separated from code, harder to keep in sync with implementation, lacks version control integration

2. **Issue tracker or project management tool**
   - Pros: Links directly to work items, built-in discussion features
   - Cons: Decision rationale can get buried in discussion threads, poor long-term discoverability

3. **No formal decision documentation**
   - Pros: No immediate overhead
   - Cons: Continued knowledge loss, repeated discussions, inconsistent implementation

## Future Direction
This approach to ADRs represents our initial implementation based on our current understanding. As we actively use ADRs in our development process, we expect to gain valuable insights that will inform both our internal practices and our product development.

We recognize that best practices for architectural decision documentation continue to evolve across the industry. Our approach should remain flexible to incorporate these learnings as we discover them. The experience of creating, maintaining, and referencing our own ADRs will provide us with authentic perspectives on how AI can best augment this process.

Our ADR practice will evolve based on our organizational learning and the patterns we observe. As we identify improvements to the process, format, or organization of our ADRs, we will document these changes in new ADRs that supersede this one.

By maintaining a living ADR system that we actively use and refine, we ensure that our understanding of architectural decision documentation remains grounded in practical experience rather than theoretical ideals.
